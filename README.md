# Melanoma_NetworkMorphology
Code for "Cell morphology and network topology: analytics and relationships to tumor heterogeneity and dissemination"

Code is divided into two parts: 

	Cell instance segmentation - based on MASK-RCNN public code repo and adapted for cell images with custom NMS scripts.

	Morphoscripts - morphological analysis, clustering, datavisualization, and plotting scripts that use segmentation output data.
